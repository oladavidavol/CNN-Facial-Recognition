# CNN-Facial-Recognition
This facial recognition model is a lightweight Convoluted Neutral Network deployed using transfer learning and DNN for facial detection
It was created as part of my MSc Data Science dissertation
This model uses TensorFlow, OpenCV
The Transfer learniong was done using VGGFace
DNN was used for the facial detection 
It is designed to be lightweight, so that it can be deployed on any resonably provisioned smartphone.
The average facial image dataset this model generates for training contains 60 images, and is about 200KB
The model uses image augmentation to increase the size of the dataset.
This file is segmented into the three components of the system
1. Facial detection
2. Model Training and Evaluation
3. Facial Recognition

Possible applications of this model will be for facial recognititon use cases where the device used needs to be mobile, or where internet access is not guaranteed.
These include search and rescue in remote areas, law enforcement, voter accreditation and access control devices.
